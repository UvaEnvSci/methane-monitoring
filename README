The files contained here are part of a project on measuring the concentration of atmospheric methane near hydrofracturing sites using low-cost sensors.
* Sensor data will be acquired using a Seeeduino Stalker v2.3 board and the Arduino IDE. The directory 'Arduino' contains the sketches made in the IDE.
* Sensor data will be distributed in real-time to the internet, to a google application written in Python. The directory 'GoogleApp' contains the main.py file
for the Google Application that logs and stores the sensor data and the home.html file for the website that shows the sensor data.
