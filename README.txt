The files contained here are part of a project on measuring the concentration of atmospheric methane near hydrofracturing sites using low-cost sensors.
The sensor data will be distributed over a local network to the internet, to a google application.
The files in this depository are scripts that will be used to handle the incoming sensor data and build the data into real-time figures on a webpage.
